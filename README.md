# GetPS3UpdatePackages
A simple C# Console Application that downloads the latest update package (.pkg) file for a given PS3 game.
All you need to do is run the compiled EXE file, then enter the game's unique ID. This tool will take care of the rest from there.
If there are any issues, please report them to R.A.G#6392 on Discord.
